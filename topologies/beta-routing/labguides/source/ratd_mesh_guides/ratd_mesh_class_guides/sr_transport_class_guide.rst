#. Enable Segment-Routing extensions to IS-IS, leveraging MPLS data plane encapsulation.
   
   - The Segment Routing Global Block (SRGB) label range should be 900,000 â€“ 965,535 on all Service Provider nodes.

#. Configure each node should with a globally unique Node SID equal to 900,000 + NodeID.

   - For example, EOS1 should have a Node SID of 900,001.

#. Review IS-IS adjacency SIDs on EOS2 and EOS5.

   :Question:
      Is there overlap? If so, will this present an issue? Why or Why not?

#. Validate that all Service Provider nodes have a globally unique Node SID.

#. To protect against black holes, and reduce convergence time:

   - Enable the equivalent of IGP Sync and Session-Protection within the Segment-Routing domain.

#. Once this task has been completed, all Service Provider nodes should have an LSP established for reachability between loopbacks.
