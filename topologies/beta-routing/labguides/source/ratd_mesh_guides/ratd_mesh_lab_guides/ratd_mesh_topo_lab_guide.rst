Lab Guide Overview
=================================================

This is the full topology that will be used for the labs in this section.  Each section 
will highlight the individual nodes that are relavent to the service or protocol for that 
step. The **Lab** Guides in the Routing ATD are meant to provide example configurations with 
step-by-step instruction on setting up IS-IS, Segment Routing, BGP EVPN, etc. If you are 
already familiar with the protocols and configurations and would instead prefer to test 
your knowledge with only high-level direction on the steps necessary to deploy the Service 
Provider network, please refer to the **Class** Guides instead.
