Lab Guide Overview
=================================================

This is the full topology that will be used for the labs in this section.  Each section will highlight the individual nodes 
that are relavent to the service or protocol for that step. The **Lab** Guides in the Routing ATD are meant to provide example 
configurations with step-by-step instruction on setting up IS-IS, Segment Routing, BGP EVPN, etc. If you are already familiar 
with the protocols and configurations and would instead prefer to test your knowledge with only high-level direction on the 
steps necessary to deploy the Service Provider network, please refer to the **Class** Guides instead.
 
   .. note::

      In the Ring Topology, EOS2 and EOS5 are not used and all interfaces connecting to them are disabled.
