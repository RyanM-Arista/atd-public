#. Configure IS-IS to carry underlay IPv4 prefix reachability information.

   - All nodes should be within the same flooding domain.

   - All nodes should only maintain a Level-2 database.

   - Ensure that there are no unnecessary Pseudonodes within the topology

#. (Optional) Only advertise reachability information for /32 loopback interfaces into the LSDB

   - Once this task has been completed, all Service Provider nodes should be able to ping all other node loopback addresses
