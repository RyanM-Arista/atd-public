Class Guide Overview
=================================================

This is the full topology that will be used for the labs in this section.  Each section 
will highlight the individual nodes that are relavent to the service or protocol for that 
step. The **Class** Guides in the Routing ATD are meant to provide high-level direction on the 
steps necessary to deploy the Service Provider network while not providing explicit examples 
of configurations to use. This implies that the operator is familiar with the configurations 
necessary to deploy IS-IS, Segment Routing, BGP EVPN, etc. If you would instead prefer to 
see example configurations with step-by-step instruction, please refer to the **Lab** Guides 
instead.
