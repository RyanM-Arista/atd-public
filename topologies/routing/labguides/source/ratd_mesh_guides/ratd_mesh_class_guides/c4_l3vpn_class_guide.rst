=========================================================================
Prepare for Customer-4 Layer 3 VPN Services
=========================================================================

#. On all PE nodes that are connected to Customer-4 CE nodes, define VRF "CUSTOMER-4".

   - Ensure IPv4 Unicast Forwarding is enabled.

   - Route-Target for import and export should be 4:4.

   - Route-Distinguisher should be X.X.X.X:4 (X = Node-ID).

#. Place the appropriate interfaces on the PE nodes into VRF “CUSTOMER-4”.

=========================================================================
Establish PE-CE peering with Customer-4
=========================================================================
 
#. Configure EOS18 and EOS19 should as BGP AS 200.

   - EOS18 should originate the following network via BGP (any method of network origination is acceptable):

      - 18.18.18.18/32

   - EOS19 should originate the following network via BGP (any method of network origination is acceptable):

      - 19.19.19.19/32

#. Establish eBGP IPv4 Unicast peerings between Customer-4 CE and Service Provider PE devices.  These peerings should be within the Customer-4 VPN (VRF).

#. Verify reachability between Customer-4 CE devices by pinging each other’s Loopback0 interface when sourcing the pings from their own Loopback0 interface.
